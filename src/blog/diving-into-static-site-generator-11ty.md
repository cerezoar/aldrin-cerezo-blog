# {{title}}

I've been trying out a few Static Site Generators (SSGs) for a while now and finally settled with 11ty or spelled-out as Eleventy. Here are some of my consideration in choosing it to create simple websites using Nunjucks as my templating language.

### Why I chose Eleventy?

#### 1. Templating Language Flexibility

One of the key advantages of Eleventy is its support for a wide range of template languages. Whether you prefer working with JavaScript, Markdown, Nunjucks, Handlebars, Mustache, EJS, Haml, Pug, or another language, Eleventy has you covered. This flexibility allows developers to work in the language they're most comfortable with, enhancing productivity and efficiency.

#### 2. Simplicity with Batteries Included

Eleventy was designed with simplicity in mind. Unlike other static site generators, it doesn't require you to learn a specific templating engine or a new set of tools. Its zero-config setup means you can get a project up and running quickly. But if you need more control, Eleventy also offers options for customization.

#### 3. Speed

Speed is another area where Eleventy shines. It probably have least effects for my use case for now but it is capable of generating a large number of pages in a short amount of time, which can be a significant advantage for larger websites or developers working under tight deadlines.

#### 4. Data Handling

Eleventy offers a unique and powerful approach to data handling. Usage of data files, front matter, and even JavaScript functions to inject data into your templates. This feature allows me for a high degree of customization and I can do or implement when building dynamic websites in the future.

#### 5. Community and Documentation

Eleventy boasts a growing community and excellent documentation. These resources can be invaluable for me who is new to the tool and encounter problems. The documentation is clear, comprehensive, and includes plenty of examples to help get me started.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, Eleventy is a flexible, simple, and fast static site generator with powerful data handling capabilities. Its support for multiple template languages, zero-config setup, and excellent documentation make it a great choice for developers of all skill levels. Whether I am creating a personal blog or a complex, data-driven website projects, Eleventy can help me get the job done efficiently and effectively. My plan is to be proficient in this framework to use it for personal and commercial projects in the future.

Feel free to reach out and let me know what you think about SSGs or 11ty as tool in creating websites.

Cheers!
